    "Some differences from the logistic regression model to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CNN model might take a while to train. Depending on your machine, you might expect this to take up to half an hour. If you see your validation performance start to plateau, you can kill the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The logistic regression model we used previously was pretty basic, and as such, we were able to get away with using the GradientDescentOptimizer, which performs implements the gradient descent algorithm. For more difficult optimization spaces (such as the ones deep networks pose), we might want to use more sophisticated algorithms. Prof David Carlson has a lecture on this later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Because of the larger size of our network, notice that our minibatch size has shrunk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- We've added a validation step every 250 minibatches. This let's us see how our model is doing during the training process, rather than sit around twiddling our thumbs and hoping for the best when training finishes. This becomes especially significant as training regimens start approaching days and weeks in length. Normally, we validate on the entire validation set, but for the sake of time we'll just stick to 10 validation minibatches (500 images) for this homework assignment."
